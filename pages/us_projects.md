**2019 - Present**

In Fall 2019, the MBON federal sponsors (NOAA, NASA, ONR and BOEM) announced six new MBON projects:

*   Francisco Chavez, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute: [The CeNCOOS MBON: Integrating remote sensing, _in situ_ data and models to understand central California ecosystem responses to environmental change](/pages/ccmbon/)
*   Katrin Iken, University of Alaska - Fairbanks: [A sustainable, integrated AMBON in the Chukchi Sea](/pages/ambon/)
*   Maria Kavanaugh, Oregon State University: [Marine Biodiversity Observing Network in the Northern California Current: Understanding patterns and drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning from plankton to seascapes](/pages/nccmbon/)
*   Bob Miller, University of California - Santa Barbara: [Southern California Bight Marine Biodiversity Observation Network](/pages/scbmbon/)
*   Ru Morrison, Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS): [MBON expansion into the Gulf of Maine: the NERACOOS/NROC Integrated Sentinel Monitoring Network (ISMN)](/pages/gommbon/)
*   Frank Muller-Karger, University of South Florida: [Implementing a Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) in South Florida to Advance Ecosystem-Based Management](/pages/sfmbon/)

**2014 - 2018**

The above projects are intended to build on the lessons learned and the progress made during the initial set of U.S. MBON demonstration projects:
