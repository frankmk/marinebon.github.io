In Fall 2019, the MBON federal sponsors (NOAA, NASA, ONR and BOEM) announced six new MBON projects:

*   Francisco Chavez, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute: The CeNCOOS MBON: Integrating remote sensing, in situ data and models to understand central California ecosystem responses to environmental change
*   Katrin Iken, University of Alaska - Fairbanks: A sustainable, integrated AMBON in the Chukchi Sea
*   Maria Kavanaugh, Oregon State University: Marine Biodiversity Observing Network in the Northern California Current: Understanding patterns and drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning from plankton to seascapes
*   Bob Miller, University of California - Santa Barbara: Southern California Bight Marine Biodiversity Observation Network
*   Ru Morrison, Northeastern Regional Association of Coastal Ocean Observing Systems (NERACOOS): MBON expansion into the Gulf of Maine: the NERACOOS/NROC Integrated Sentinel Monitoring Network (ISMN)
*   Frank Muller-Karger, University of South Florida: Implementing a Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON) in South Florida to Advance Ecosystem-Based Management

*   **2014-2018**
The above projects are intended to build on the lessons learned and the progress made during the initial set of US MBON demonstration projects:
